## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing sales data (2014-2017) to identify trends, top-performing products, and key revenue drivers across the United States. The final output is an interactive excel dashboard featuring a cohesive purple-themed UI that allows stakeholders to filter data by year and category.
The goal was to transform raw sales data into a visual narrative to assist in understanding customer behavior and regional performance.
